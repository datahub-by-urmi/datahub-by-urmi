### About Me

I'm Urmi Soni, a recent Drexel MS Business Analytics graduate with a passion for transforming data into business value. My expertise lies in data engineering, where I design and automate the workflows that power data-driven decisions.

My core skills include SQL, Python, and Tableau, along with hands-on experience building ETL pipelines and creating interactive dashboards on cloud platforms. I combine a strong foundation in analytics with a problem-solving mindset and a drive to learn.

I believe insights are most powerful when they are communicated effectively. I specialize in data storytelling, turning complex data into compelling narratives that resonate with people and drive real change. My GitHub is a creative playground where I let my data speak for itself. ðŸ“Šâœ¨

I'm open to new opportunities and excited to explore how I can create value with data.

ðŸŒŸ Fun Facts

I enjoy blending analytics with storytelling because insights only matter when they resonate. People believe what they can see in your work â€” and here on my GitHub, I let my data speak for itself.

GitHub is more than a code repository to me â€” itâ€™s a creative data playground, a place where I experiment, share ideas, and demonstrate the real-world impact of analytics.

A Netflix-inspired interface to showcase my analytics projects with interactive visualizations instead of movies. Explore dashboards, dive into datasets, and see how I transform complex data into actionable insights.
