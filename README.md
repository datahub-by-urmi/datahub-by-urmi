### About Me
ðŸ‘‹ Hey, there!
Iâ€™m Urmi Soni.

I started my journey as a curious problem-solver, diving into numbers and patterns, which led me to pursue an MS in Business Analytics at Drexel University. Along the way, I discovered my passion for data engineering, designing pipelines and automating workflows that power business decisions.

My superpowers ðŸ’ª are data wrangling, visualization, cloud platforms, and connecting the dots to solve complex problems.

ðŸ“Š Started with curiosity about numbers and business problems.

ðŸ§¾ Learned SQL, Python, Tableau, and cloud plateforms through projects and coursework.
ðŸ’¥ Built hands-on experience with ETL pipelines, dashboards, and cloud workflows.
ðŸ¤“ I bring problem-solving, persistence, and a love for learning to every project.

ðŸŒŸ Fun Facts

I enjoy blending analytics with storytelling because insights only matter when they resonate. People believe what they can see in your work â€” and here on my GitHub, I let my data speak for itself.

GitHub is more than a code repository to me â€” itâ€™s a creative data playground, a place where I experiment, share ideas, and demonstrate the real-world impact of analytics.

ðŸ“‚ Featured Projects (Coming soon)

Gitflix | Portfolio + Datahub
A Netflix-inspired interface to showcase my analytics projects with interactive visualizations instead of movies. Explore dashboards, dive into datasets, and see how I transform complex data into actionable insights.
